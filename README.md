# Plan, a timetable generator for NTNU students

This piece of software started out as a simple tool to assist in creating
readable timetables for NTNU courses. The earliest version of the site provided
this functionality and nothing more. As more fellow students started using the
software new features where added based on personal needs and suggestions from
other students.

## Today the software provides the following:

- Simple interface for adding courses.
- Customizable view of your timetable.
- Easy export to Google-Calendar via iCal.
- PDF-version for printing.
- User defined deadlines.
- Import of course data from ntnu.no or database-dumps.
